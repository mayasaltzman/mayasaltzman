<h1>Hello! 👋 </h1>
<h2>🤸🏻 About Me</h2>
<p>🚀 My name is Maya Saltzman and I am a third year Computer Science Honors Co-op Student at the University of Guelph. 
</p>
<p>💻 I have interests in back-end and database development, however I am always flexible when it comes to my learning!</p>
<p>🌲 A fun fact about me is that I grew up canoe tripping. I have been on a month long trip through
the back lakes of North Western Ontario. This experience provided me with a passion for sustainability and I hope to work on
environmentally sustainable technology in the future!</p>
